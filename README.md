# Tailwind CSS flex items-center unexpected spacing/misalignment

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS related to the `flex items-center` utility.  The bug manifests as unexpected spacing or misalignment when combining `items-center` with other classes, such as `bg-*` (background color) and `w-* h-*` (width/height). The issue is more pronounced in certain browsers and when responsive modifiers are involved.

The `bug.html` file shows the problematic code that produces the unexpected behavior. The `bugSolution.html` file presents a solution.
