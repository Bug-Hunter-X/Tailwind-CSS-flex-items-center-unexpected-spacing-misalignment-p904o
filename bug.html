The following Tailwind CSS code produces an unexpected outcome:

```html
<div class="flex items-center">
  <div class="bg-red-500 w-10 h-10"></div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 w-10 h-10"></div>
</div>
```

This code is intended to display two squares, one red and one blue, side by side with vertically centered alignment. However, the result may show unexpected spacing or misalignment between the squares, especially in certain browsers or when using specific responsive modifiers.
