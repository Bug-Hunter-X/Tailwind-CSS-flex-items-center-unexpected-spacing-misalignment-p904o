To solve the misalignment issue, adding the `space-x-*` utility often resolves the problem, providing consistent spacing between the flex items.  Here's the corrected code:

```html
<div class="flex items-center space-x-2">
  <div class="bg-red-500 w-10 h-10"></div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 w-10 h-10"></div>
</div>
```

This ensures proper spacing, leading to a more predictable and consistent visual layout.
